I have created a console app to help restaurants return more revenue. My goal is to create an interactive booking system where customers can book seats based on their preferences without having to wait on busy phone lines before getting a reservation.

These are the concepts I have learnt so far and implimented in this java console project
Learning unit 1: Advanced arrays 

- Sort an array using the bubble sort algorithm in ascending or descending order 
- Describe how the bubble sort can be modified for improved efficiency 
- Describe a more efficient method of sorting, namely the insertion sort. 
- Create two subscripts to access an element in a two-dimensional array 
- View a two-dimensional array in memory 
- Pass a two-dimensional array to a method 
- Use the length field with a two-dimensional array 
- Use the length field with a two-dimensional array 
- Use the methods of the Array class 
- Create containers that store lists of objects using ArrayList class 
- Compare ArrayList Class to Arrays class 
- Apply enum methods 

Learning Unit 2: Introduction to inheritance 

- Apply the concept of inheritance 
- Extend classes 
- Override superclass methods
- Call constructors during inheritance 
- Access superclass methods 
- Apply information hiding 
- Explain which methods you cannot override
